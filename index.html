		<marquee class="marquee">The Constitution of India doesn’t tell you what India is. Because in practice, India is medieval, feudal, deeply divided across caste and communal lines, and ruled not by laws but by patriarchal power structures. Everyday India has very little to do with the India described by our Constitution. What the document really is, is a statement of intent. It describes the India that we want to be. It lays down the rules of an India that existed in the dreams of the country’s founding mothers and fathers. It says all Indians should be equal in the eyes of the law because they knew that that was not the case then. It says that religion should play no role in the decisions made by the Government because they knew it often did. It says people should ave the right to express themselves and freedom of speech because they understood that the people did not. The Constitution of India is a dream. It is what this country can be. What it should be. What it will be.

									  <p>Three days after a Noida youth opened fire at protests in Delhi's Jamia Milia Islamia, unidentified gunmen once again fired shots around the university.
					According to reports, the incident of firing was reported near Gate number 5 of Jamia Millia Islamia. Locals say two men came on a scooty and fired shots in the air and fled the scene. No casualties have been reported so far. A statement issued by the Jamia Coordination Committee, a group comprising students and alumni of the varsity, said the attackers were on a red scooter. The incident on Sunday night triggered panic in the area. A police vehicle had reached the spot after the incident but was chased away by angry students.
					Hundreds of students and locals gathered outside the university.</p>

				  <p>Three FIRs have been filed in connection with two deaths at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest at Jalangi town in West Bengal’s Murshidabad earlier this week, ThePrint has learnt. The deaths occurred because of shootings that took place during the protest, and police said local tensions between two groups were to blame.
The sequence of events pieced together by police so far suggests that the web of local tensions allegedly culminated in the firing of guns Wednesday — tensions that are believed to have sparked clashes despite the warring sides’ shared resentment against the CAA.
The suspects include Tohiruddin Mondal, a local block president affiliated with the Trinamool Congress, who is now at large. The victims were a minor, Salauddin Sheikh, 17, and a cleric named Anarul Biswas, 60.</p>

				  <p>The shooter who opened fire in Jamia Nagar on Thursday has been sent to preventive custody for 14 days. According to the police, the shooter is being held as a juvenile on the basis of his Class 10 mark-sheet and Aadhaar card.
However, the police have moved the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for a bone ossification test to verify the age of the accused. Once allowed, the age test will be done at RML Hospital in Delhi.
Sources say that the police won’t be able to question him for the next 14 days. "We have questioned him for 24 hours and based on the statement he has given, we will question people associated with him," said an officer.
The initial round of investigation into the Jamia firing incident has revealed that the teenage shooter was self-radicalised. He has told interrogators of Delhi Police that over the past two years he started reading incendiary posts on social media.
The shooter, who brandished a gun in front of Delhi Police personnel on Thursday and shot at a Jamia university student, has told interrogators that every day he would listen to speeches online and share offensive posts. During the questioning, sources say, there was no remorse by the shooter on the crime he committed.</p>

Kamra had posted a video on Twitter Tuesday where he is seen questioning Goswami on his “journalism” and political views. Following this, Indigo released a statement that said it was banning Kamra for six months due to his “unacceptable behaviour” and also advised passengers “to refrain from indulging in personal slander whilst onboard”. Union Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri also called his behavior “offensive” and urged other airlines to impose similar restrictions on Kamra.

In the petition, the filmmakers contended: “The petitioners state and submit that the common thread that runs through some of the documentaries that were not selected for the competition or exhibition including the petitioners’ documentaries is that they are critical of the current political dispensation and/or critical of the political philosophy that they claim to espouse.”
They further alleged that unregulated discretionary powers, including pre-selection process of MIFF, juxtaposed with the fact with the non-selection of all documentaries critical of the current Union government, the political party in power and their political ideology, points towards clear malafide use of discretionary of power.</p>

				  <p>The Delhi Police booked Sharjeel Imam, an activist who came in limelight during the ongoing protest in Shaheen Bagh, on Sunday for allegedly delivering inflammatory speeches against the amended Citizenship Act and the planned National Register of Citizens, officials said.
According to the police, Imam, a resident of Bihar and former Jawaharlal Nehru University student, delivered “very inflammatory and instigatory speeches in his opposition to CAA and NRC”. 
“He had previously delivered one such speech in Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13 last year and thereafter one even more inflammatory against the government which is being widely circulated on social media,” they said. These speeches have the “potential to harm the religious harmony” and the unity and integrity of India, for which the case was registered against him, police said.</p>
